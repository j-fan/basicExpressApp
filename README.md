This was for my personal use, decided to share.

Super minimal node app using Express, Stylus and Pug.
Uses nodemon to restart server on file changes and reload to refresh browser.

"npm i" to install

"npm start" to run

it contains a basic pug page at views/index.pug, and basic stylus in stylus/index.styl
