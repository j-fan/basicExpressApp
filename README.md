This was for my personal use, decided to share.

Super minimal node app using Express, Stylus and Pug.
Uses nodemon to restart server on file changes and reload to refresh browser.

"npm i" to install

"npm start" to run

"npm run-script make" to compile pug/stylus into html/css in the docs folder. A github page can be made from this with no other modifications.

it contains a basic pug page at views/index.pug, and basic stylus in stylus/index.styl
